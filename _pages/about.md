I'm a first-year Ph.D. student at the Computer Science Engineering Department at the University of Connecticut under the supervision of Professor Sheida Nabavi. Before joining the CSE department, I was a doctoral student at the Department of Statistics at the University of Connecticut for one year. I obtained my master's in Statistics from the George Washington University in 2017 and my bachelor in Mathematics from Boston University in 2014.
